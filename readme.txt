----HAMURABI CLONE----

    The goal of this program, while beginning as a pure clone of the 1968
game Hamurabi, is to transform that base into a horror game. Is it even
possible to adjust the design in slight ways to build tension and maybe
fear in this type of genre? That's what I'm trying to see and to get a 
better understanding of horror and fear in the process.
